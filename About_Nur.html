        <h2>Wondering Who I am?</h2>
        <p>I am Nur, a lovely city Eskişehir Turkey based, UI/UX designer, focused on human experience and visual design.
          Since my childhood I have always been passionate about creativity. Getting new hobbies and learning new things always make me excited and allow me to enter my fantasy world. I enjoy the process and outcome of creative projects and this
          inspires a big sense of contentment inside me.Throughout high school, I loved Math and Physics and I
          graduated from Material Science and Engineering. Years later, I
          still had a feeling that I wasn’t living to my full potential. At that
          times, I lived in Berlin almost three years, I have learnt German
          and met creative people. That provided
          me to expand my horizon and I decided to combine my analytical and creative thinking in my future career.
          After I researched UX/UI design field and tech industry for about two months, I made sure that this is exactly the type of career I’ve been looking for. I signed up for UI Design course at CareerFoundry which prepared me to be a designer
          from scratch.
          Thanks to all of my former experiences as a market researcher and data preparation and control operator allow me to add value to my user research skills.
          This was a my short journey that I started to approach my passion. I am currently seeking a UI/UX role that I could do my job with passion and apply all the things I have learnt during my design journey. Let’s connect.
